# Contributing

Thank you very much for contributing!

Our inclusion criteria:
- The app is an app for android devices
- The app is Free and Open Source Software
  - It doesn't include proprietary software blobs
- The Source Code is publicly available, preferrably git-based
- It respects the users privacy (Not tracking the user)
- (optional) The app is available on F-Droid

You may submit apps with antifeatures such as:
- Connecting to non-free servers
- Non-free parts such as licensed images, but no proprietary code

*Please make sure you keep the alphabetic order.*

The syntax is the following:

```markdown
  - [AppName](Link to Homepage) - Short description. ([F-Droid](Link to the app on F-Droid), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```

If the app doesn't have a homepage, use:

```markdown
  - Appname - Short description. ([F-Droid](Link to the app on F-Droid), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```

If the app is not on F-Droid, provide a link to the page where you can get the .apk file (no direct link), it **must** be from the developer.
Please use "non-free APK" if the .apk includes non-free parts.
The syntax is:

```markdown
  - Appname - Short description. ([APK](Link to the download page of the .apk), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```

If the app uses or connects to non-free servers, includes non-free parts or has other antifeatures, please make sure you want to include this app. If there's an alternative with similar features and no antifeatures, include it instead.

If you are sure there is no better alternative, mark those apps like this:

```markdown
 - Appname - Short description ([F-Droid](Link to the app on F-Droid), [Source Code](Link to the source code)) :warning: A few words about the antifeature.
```

If you want to add another category, use the following syntax:

```markdown
  - [Category name](#category-name)
```

In the list, insert the category with:

```markdown
## Category name
```

Make sure #category-name is identical to the actual category name (spaces are replaced with a `-`).

Feel free to use emojis if you want to.
